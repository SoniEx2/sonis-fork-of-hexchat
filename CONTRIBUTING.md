Inclusive language
------------------

This project has an inclusive language policy. Due to the long history of this
codebase, this policy only applies to new contributions. For everything else,
"we'll get to it when we get to it" applies.

Inclusive language is important so as to not trivialize others' experiences.
For example:

- **DON'T** say "abusing the protocol"
    **DO** say "misusing the protocol"
